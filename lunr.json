Started","path":"/hexo-theme-doc/get-started.html","body":"Get started Requirements To get started you need to have a couple of things installed: NodeJS Git Installing Hexo Once all the requirements are installed, you can install Hexo with npm: 1 $ npm install -g hexo-cli Quick Start To quickly bootstrap a documentation website, we have setup an example seed project that can be cloned and used a starting point. Clone the seed project 1 $ git clone https://github.com/zalando-incubator/hexo-theme-doc-seed.git Go into the resulting directory and install the dependencies 1 $ cd hexo-theme-doc-seed &amp;&amp; npm install Start the preview server 1 $ hexo s This command will run a built-in http server and watch for changes. If you open your browser to http://localhost:4000 you should see the documentation website up and running. Nice! Now you can start writing your content… have fun! To know more, please check server and generating from the official Hexo documentation. Long Start This section assumes that you are familiar with Hexo usage. For new starters we suggest you have a look at the Quick Start guide. Install via npm (recommended) 1 $ npm install git+ssh://git@github.com:zalando-incubator/hexo-theme-doc.git --save Symlink the package in the themes folder.
